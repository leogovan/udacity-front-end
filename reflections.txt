I have learned some basic tags, how to structure html docs using nested elements and indentation to make my code more readable.

I found the tags quite easy at this stage and some prior knowledge meant that the html tree was an already familiar concept.

The only thing that caused me an issue was the mis-formatting of the relative path (I had the preceding ‘/‘ at the beginning and I went around this for a while before working it out).

I used MDN to help me find answers to specific tags I was less familiar with.
